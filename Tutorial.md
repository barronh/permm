# Tutorial #
PERMM is a portal to working with process analysis data.  PERMM allows for interactive exploration of the data and for dynamic analysis design.  Dynamic analysis design allows for a single analysis to be applied to many different chemical mechanisms.  PERMM has the capability to be used with 3D models (CAMx, CMAQ, and WRF-Chem) and box models (CMAQ, Morpho, and KPP).  In this tutorial, we'll work with 3-D data that has already been prepared for use in PERMM (for more details see [https://dawes.sph.unc.edu/trac/pyPA pyPA]).  All the tutorials use [https://github.com/barronh/permm/blob/master/src/permm/testdata/test.mrg.nc](https://github.com/barronh/permm/blob/master/src/permm/testdata/test.mrg.nc), so download it and always have it ready.
